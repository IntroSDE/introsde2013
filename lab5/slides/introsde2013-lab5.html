## Outline

* REST principles recap
* Building REST Services Servlet Example
* Building REST Services with Jersey

---

## What's REST?

* The term Representational State Transfer (REST) was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation
* It is an **architectural style** of networked systems (not a protocol - not a specification), by which **resources** are exposed through out the system. 
* REST is a client-server architecture.
* Only representations of **resources** are exposed to the client
* The representation of resources places the client application in a **state**.
* Client state may evolve by **traversing hyperlinks** and obtaining **new representations**


---

## REST Principles
* Resource identification through **URI**
* **Uniform interface:** resources are manipulated using a fixed set operations (HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods) 
* Self-descriptive messages: resources are decoupled from their representation

---


## REST Principles: RESTful Flavor

*  **Stateful interactions through hyperlinks:** every interaction with a resource is stateless (i.e., request messages are self-contained) 


---

## REST principles: resources 

* Resource: Any *thing* (noun) that is worthy of being given a unique ID (URI) and be accessible via client
* Resources are something the server is responsible for managing Resources must have representations to be ’transmitted’ to client

e.g., resources in the starbucks example: order, payment (represented in XML)

---

## REST principles: uniform interface

**Uniform Interface:** Uniform ‘verbs’ that go with the resources (noun)

* Given a resource (coffee order): a representation in XML

```xml
<order xmlns="urn:starbucks">
   <drink>latte</drink>
</order>
```

* POST /starbucks/orders (to create an order)
  * returns: location: /starbucks/orders/order?id=1234
* GET /starbucks/orders/order?id=1234 (to read an order)
* PUT /starbucks/orders/order?id=1234 (to update an existing order)
* DELETE /starbucks/orders/order?id=1234 (to delete an existing order)

---

## REST principles: hypermedia


**Connectedness/Links:** Resources may contain links to other resources
e.g., Order resource is linked to Payment resource

**In response to POSTing an order**
```
201 Created
Location: /starbucks/orders/order?id=1234
Content-Type: application/xml
Content-Length: ...
<order xmlns="urn:starbucks">
  <drink>latte</drink>
  <link rel="payment" href="/starbucks/payments/order?id=1234"
          type="application/xml"/>
</order>
```

Both forward/backward links, when possible (e.g., order having ’cancel/delete’ link)

## REST principles: satefy and idempotence
REST Uniform Interface, if properly followed, gives you two properties:

* **Safety (GET):** Read-only operations. The operations on a resource do not change any server state. The client can call the operations 10 times, 1000 times, it has no effect on the server state.
* **Idempotence (GET, PUT and DELETE):** Operations that have the same “effect" whether you apply them once or more than once. An effect here may well be a change of server state. An operation on a resource is idempotent if making a request once has the same effect as making the identical request multiple times.


---

## REST principles: representations

One resource, many representations

---

## REST principles: representations

* **XML**
```xml
<animals>
  <dog>
    <name>Rufus</name>
    <breed>Labrador</breed>
  </dog>
  <dog>
    <name>Marty</name>
    <breed>whippet</breed>
  </dog>
  <cat name="Matilda" />
</animals>
```
* **JSON**
```json
{ animals : {
  dog: [  {   name:"Rufus",
          breed:"Labrador"
      },
      { 
        name:"Marty",
          breed:"whippet"
      }
    ],
  cat : {
      name:"Matilda" 
    }
  }
}
```

## Building REST Services

* REST does not requires you to use a specific client or server-side framework in order to write your Web services. All you need is: 
  * a client or server that supports the HTTP protocol (i.e., a web server, a browser).
  * choose a language of your choice
* **In Java:** You’d use servlets and override doGet(), doPost(), doPUT() and doDelete()
  * URLs contains: servlet path + path info (all you need to process a request in REST)
  * You could use a third-party library for generating specific content type (CSV, JSON or XML, etc.) or use Strings concatenations for simple responses.

## Configuration - Eclipse WTP (1)

* For the lab, we will use **Eclipse WTP**, which provides tools for developing standard Java web applications and Java EE applications
* To install, use **Help -> Install new software -> All Available Sites**
  * You can also use only the WTP repository: **http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/repository/kepler** (might change according to your version of eclipse)
* Search for **"Web Tools Platform"** and install all what's inside that category (using the latest version)
* In old versions of eclipse, there might be a category "Web, XML, Java EE Development and OSGi Enterprise Development". Install all inside. 

---

## Configuration - Eclipse WTP (2)

## Configuration - Tomcat Server in Eclipse (1)

* The first step is to configure a Runtime Environment for Tomcat
* In eclipse, go to **Preferences -> Server -> Runtime Environments -> Add**
* Select your version of Tomcat.
* To compile the JSP into servlets you need to use the JDK. You can check your setup by clicking on the Installed JRE button.
* Press Finish and then OK. You are now ready to use Tomcat with WTP.

---
 
## Configuration - Tomcat Server in Eclipse (2)

* Second step is to create a running **Tomcat Server**
* Open the Server view for this: **Window -> Show View -> Other -> Server -> Servers**
* If no server is available, you need to create a new one (just follow the steps of the wizard)
* Once the server is created, double click on it to open its configuration file
* I reccomend you mark "use tomcat installation"
